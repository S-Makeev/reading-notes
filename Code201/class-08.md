# Readings: CSS Layout

**-Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.**

It designed to help style and adjust inline content and its surrounding elements. So multiple elements in one row would adjust in accordance with each others size. 

**-Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.**

The main difference is that the main axis runs horizontally so it controls columns, while corss axis runs vertically, so it controls rows. 


**-How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?**

the row-reverse and column-reverse change elements visually, but the logical order would still remain, and that could worsen accessibility. 

**-What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?**

It's easier to control child elements with flexbox, it's more responsive and mobile friendly, it's easy to change the order of elements without manipulating html.

**-How does this topic connect with your long term goals?**

It's quite interesting to know about styling elements and how they interact between one another, but it doesn't really connect with my long term goal, as I'm more interested in back-end.
