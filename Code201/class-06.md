**-How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?**

An object is a kind of entity, that has certain parameters and characteristics. For example, a car is an object, that has parameters, such as color, make, model. It has wheels, doors and so on. 

**-What are some advantages to creating object literals?**

The main advantage is the ability to wrap some logic or multiple properties into one object, which makes code much more flexible, maintainable and helps avoiding "spaghetti code".


**-How do objects differ from arrays?**

Arrays can be accessed by index, while object can be accessed by strings or symbols. Also, order in the array is indexed, while order inside the object is flexible.
