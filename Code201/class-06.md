**-How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?**

An object is a kind of entity, that has certain parameters and characteristics. For example, a car is an object, that has parameters, such as color, make, model. It has wheels, doors and so on. 

**-What are some advantages to creating object literals?**

The main advantage is the ability to wrap some logic or multiple properties into one object, which makes code much more flexible, maintainable and helps avoiding "spaghetti code".


**-How do objects differ from arrays?**

Arrays can be accessed by index, while object can be accessed by strings or symbols. Also, order in the array is indexed, while order inside the object is flexible.

**-Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.**

If an object property name is held in a variable,then we must use bracket notation.


**-Evaluate the code below. What does the term `this` refer to and what is the advantage to using `this`?**

`This` keyword referes to the current object the code is being written inside, so in this code, `this` refers to name and age properties. 


```
const dog = {
  name: 'Spot',
  age: 2,
  color: 'white with black spots',
  humanAge: function (){
    console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age*7} in human years`);
  }
}
```
