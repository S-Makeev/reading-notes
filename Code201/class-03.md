# Readings: HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model


**- When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?**

When there's no point in ordering objects on the list.


**- How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?**

We need to use CSS list-style-type property for that.


**-When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?**

When it's useful to sequence elements, because they represent a list of instructions, for example.


**-Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?**

We can use 'reversed', 'start' or 'type' properties to alter numbers


**-Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?**

Margin is a "bodyguard" for our information inside the box. Its duty is to make sure that nobody comes too close to the box, while margin is a stylist for our information, making sure that it looks and placed nicely inside the box. 

**-List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.**

> Content box: The area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like inline-size and block-size or width and height.

>Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties.

>Border box: The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using border and related properties.

>Margin box: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using margin and >related properties.

**-What data types can you store inside of an Array?**

numbers, strings, boolean values, characters, objects.


**-Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?**

This array is valid and each element can be acessed with 'for...of' statement.

**-List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.**

'%' - remainder, '/=' - division, '-=' - substraction, "*=" - multiplication,  '+=' - addition.

**-Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.**

The result is going to be a string: "10dog", because JS is dynamically typed language.

**-Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.**

It's useful when we anticipate multiple variants of input, however we only need one type of input or specific input.

**-Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.**

It's useful to use a loop, when, for example, we have multiple values or an array, where we need to parse and store information.
