# Readings: Debugging


**-Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.**
The main difference between syntax error and logical error is that syntax error means that something was misspelled, and can in most cases be easilly fixed, while logic error means that the syntax was most likely correct, however 

**-List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.**

Most of my errors were syntax - I had to correct several typos, but nothing more serious than that.

**How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?**

It will help me with identification and fixing bugs or minor errors for sure, since I'll be going for back-end position, testing and fixing bugs is a huge part of that role.

**-How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?**
I'd present it as a tool, that allows us to track electrical current and actually see the flow. With such imaginary device, we could identify where the theoretical problem might be; what's stopping the current from flowing further. 

**-Define what a breakpoint is.**
A breakpoint is a set point at which code stops execution.

**-What is the call stack?**
Call stack shows the result of code execution on the current line.
