# Readings: Basics of HTML, CSS & JS


**- Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?**

It's extremely important for accessibility as well as SEO performance. This information is used by search engines, as well as screen readers.

**- How many levels of headings are there in HTML?**

There are six levels. 


**- What are some uses for the 'sup' and 'sub' elements?**

Those stand for: "Superscript" and "Subscript" and both can be used for writing of math formulas.


**- When using the 'abbr' element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?**


We need to add 'title' attribute, where the full word is going to be mentioned.


**- What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?**

There are three ways of how we can apply CSS.

 <li> External stylesheet (separate file)
 <li> Internal stylesheet (inside the HTML document) 
 <li> Inline stylesheet (style attribute within an element)


**- Why should we avoid using inline styles?**


They have the highest priority and therefore it would be impossible for us to make any changes to it from outside.
   
**- What is representing the selector, CSS declarations, properties?** 
  
```
 h2 {
     color: black;
     padding: 5px;
   }

```
h2 - selector, {color: black; padding:5x} - CSS declaration and 'color:', 'padding' are properties.  

**- What is the use of an 'else if'**
  Used between 'else' and 'if' for multiple variants

  === and !== — test if one value is identical to, or not identical to, another.
< and > — test if one value is less than or greater than another.
<= and >= — test if one value is less than or equal to, or greater than or equal to, another.
