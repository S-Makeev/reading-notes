**-Why are forms so important in web development?**

Forms are extremely important in web dev, as they provide main window of communication between the user and the website.

It's also a good practise to control possible input and set up warnings, so that user won't be able to input wrong data.

**-List 5 form elements and explain their importance.**
>The 'form' element formally defines a form and attributes that determine the form's behavior.
The 'fieldset' element is a convenient way to create groups of widgets that share the same purpose, for styling and semantic purposes. 
The 'label' element is the formal way to define a label for an HTML form widget. This is the most important element if you want to build accessible forms  
Many assistive technologies will use the 'legend' element as if it is a part of the label of each control inside the corresponding 'fieldset' element.   
'Input' element is used with 'label' element and is used to bond it with the inpud by id.
