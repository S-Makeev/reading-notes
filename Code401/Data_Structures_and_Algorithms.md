It's important to understand the use of recursion as it is diffrerent with each case. Sometimes it might be not the most efficient solution, but fast to implement and easier to understand.

Good highlits of Linked list, Array, Hash Table, Stack queue and Graph Trees. Most commonly used datastructures.

1)Different steps get added
2)Drop constants
3)Different inputs => different variables
4)Drop non-dominant terms

**What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?**

I'd say one of the most important things to consider while choosing a data structure is the possibility of data expansion. While at certain scales one approach will suffice, however, if we scale the incoming data, that solution might become completely unreasonable.

**How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?**

We need to insure that the base case is implemented in our function, as it's the part of our function that doens't call itself, on the contrary to recursive case.
