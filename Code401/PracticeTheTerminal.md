# Practice in the Terminal


**A command line:** text based interface that allows us the input of commands that will be executed on OS's Kernel level.

**Shell:** Part of OS that decides how it's going to react and executes commands. There are various shells, each nuanced in its own way. Most common shells are - Bash (Bourne again shell), Zsh, PowerShell, etc. 

### **Interesting facts:** 

* Everything is a file. Including directories.
* Linux is an Extensionless System. Linux system ignores the extension and looks inside the file to determine what type of file it is.
* Linux is case sensitive.   
* Spaces in directory names must be avoided to prevent confusion. 

### **Important commands:**

* **pwd** - (Print working directory), 
* **ls** - (listing of the current location /[options][location]) To show **hidden** files, use **-a** option, 
* **~(tilde)** - This is a shortcut for your home directory.
* **. (dot)** - This is a reference to your current directory.
* **.. (dotdot)** - This is a reference to the parent directory.
* **cd [location]** - change directory.
* **file [path]** - check the file's type.
* 


### Absolute and Relative Paths
* Absolute paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / )
* Relative paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash.
