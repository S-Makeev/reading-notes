# Readings: Testing and Modules

**What are the key principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python, and how do they contribute to the overall quality of code?**

The main principles of TDD include the initial design of the tests that could help with the later design of the code. Inside the tests themselves, we have the Arrange, Act and Assert principle. The next step is the Cycle which is devided into 3 steps: write a test to fail, write a feature to pass and then refactor the code. Applying tests to the code make it more reliable and less buggy, which could save time and frustration in the future.
